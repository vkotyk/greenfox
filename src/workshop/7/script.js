/*
 * 7. MORE DRAWING
 *
 * EXCERCISE 1:
 * LEVEL 1:
 * Do you remember when you were a kid trying to
 * draw the envelope with one line? 
 * Try to recreate this.
 * The envelope should be filled with red, 
 * except the one part, see picture in bottom right
 * corner.
 * The stroke can be black
 * 
 *
 * LEVEL 2:
 * Can you do it really with just one line?
 * That means you can call method fill() and stroke()
 * several times, but beginPath should be called just
 * once.
 *
 * LEVEL 3:
 * Can variables help us here?
 *
 * HELP:
 * c.fillStyle = "color";
 * c.strokeStyle = "color";
 * c.beginPath();
 * c.moveTo(100, 300);
 * c.lineTo(100,200);
 * c.fill();
 * c.stroke();
